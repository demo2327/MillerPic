# Sprint 15 Plan - Project Planning System (Jira + Confluence)

## Goal Statement
Establish a practical project management operating system that tracks roadmap, sprint execution, defects, and closeouts using Jira (free) and Confluence (free).

## User Outcomes
1. Work is visible in one backlog with priorities and owners.
2. Sprint plans and closeouts are consistent and easy to find.
3. Defects from testing map directly to delivery tasks.
4. Team decisions and architecture context are documented in one place.

## In Scope
- Jira setup blueprint:
  - project type selection
  - issue types and workflow states
  - labels/components conventions
  - sprint board columns mapped to execution reality
- Confluence structure blueprint:
  - sprint plan template
  - sprint closeout template
  - decision log template
  - test evidence page template
- Integration process:
  - link sprint docs in repo to Jira issues
  - map checklist failures to bug tickets
  - define weekly cadence and ownership model

## Out of Scope (for this sprint)
- Paid add-ons or enterprise automations
- Fully automated sync tooling between repo and Jira

## Acceptance Criteria
- A documented setup guide exists for Jira + Confluence free tier.
- Templates are created and usable for Sprint 13 onward.
- A sample sprint is represented in Jira with linked Confluence pages.
- Team can run the next sprint without ad-hoc process decisions.

## 2-Hour Timebox Strategy
- 30 min: finalize workflow model and naming conventions.
- 35 min: create Jira board/backlog structure definition.
- 35 min: create Confluence template set and usage guide.
- 10 min: define issue hygiene rules and triage cadence.
- 10 min: produce rollout checklist and closeout.

## Constraints Note
This sprint designs and documents the system; actual SaaS workspace provisioning may require manual account/admin actions by you.

## Definition of Done
- Written runbook enables immediate use of Jira/Confluence in next sprint.
- Templates and conventions are concrete, not placeholder-only.
- Risks and manual prerequisites are explicitly listed.
